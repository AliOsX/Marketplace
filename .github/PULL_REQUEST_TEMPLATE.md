Please fill out this checklist to submit your theme to the Marketplace for review.

## Theme Submission checklist

- [ ] Pull Request title is title of theme (and nothing else)
- [ ] Code changes are a [properly formatted submission](https://github.com/TryGhost/Marketplace/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] Theme passes [GScan](https://gscan.ghost.org/)

- [ ] I have read about [how the marketplace works](https://github.com/TryGhost/Marketplace/blob/master/README.md) and I completely understand that not all themes are accepted.
