# Submitting a Theme to The Marketplace

Once you have created a theme and ensured that it follows all standards, you can submit it for review to be included in the public Ghost Marketplace.

In order to create a submission, please fork the Ghost Marketplace repository and submit a Pull Request to include your theme on the site. Your pull request must contain:

- A single, new post with your theme details
    - One or two word title.
    - A single tag
    - Either "free" or "paid" category.
    - A Download URL for where to get the theme (It's fine to link to a product description page)
    - A Preview URL to a demo of the theme populated with demo content in English - See demo.ghost.io for an example. (This is required. You need to host a demo of your theme somewhere if you want it to be in the marketplace)
- A properly formatted screenshot of the **home page** of your preview/demo site. [Try this Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awesome-screenshot-screen/nlipoenfbbikpbjkfpfillcgkoblgpmj?hl=en)
    - Take screenshot at 1400px wide / full height - Then export
    - Resize to 600px wide
    - Crop to 750px height
    - Compress with TinyPNG.com (yes, it works on JPGs too)
    - Plain screenshot only
    - Make sure there are no scrollbars or artifacts visible
    - Absolutely no browser Chrome, operating system UI, or fancy reflections/shadows. No marketing text. No mobile mockup overlays. 
    - Look at all the other screenshots on marketplace.ghost.org - that's what your screenshot should look like.
    - If you try to circumvent this your submission PR will be closed without comment.
- Ensure that we can download a copy of your theme for review. If you're promoting a paid theme which doesn't have a public download, then we may ask you to send us a copy of it.
